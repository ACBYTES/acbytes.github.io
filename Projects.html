            I created this project mostly to help my grandparents when they face a problem with their phones. I used a website as a server because at the time of creating this project, I wans't able to use
            port-forwarding for some reasons.
            (Releasing the source code soon)

            I created this project when I wanted to cooperate with some friends for creating a game. I wanted to add a real-time watcher to the program but I didn't completely finish it as I was supposed to sit for
            some school exams unfortunately.

        <p class="MainBody" style="margin-top: -35px">
            I created this project for a company named EJOB and a school called Salam in my country, Iran, so that they can give raw data to the program and the program automatically checks and calculates results for each person
            and generate a report PDF for them based on their answers. Based on their answers, they get recommended some jobs and the stuff they're supposed to do on their way to reach that job and that specific goal.
            As I've coded this for a company and they're currently using it and they need updates, I'm not going to publish the source code but as soon as we end up the deal, I'll publish the source code; This is to
            secure my source code against that comapny.

            I created projects like this in C# and using WebDriver & These Projects are Actually Dependent On What You Want To Do But Everything is Possible in Thses Cases as I Create Everything From Scratch Based on What You Need.
